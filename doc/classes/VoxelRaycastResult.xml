		<member name="distance" type="float" setter="" getter="get_distance" default="0.0">
			Distance between the origin of the ray and the surface of the cube representing the hit voxel.

		<member name="position" type="Vector3i" setter="" getter="get_position" default="Vector3i(0, 0, 0)">
			Integer position of the voxel that was hit. In a blocky game, this would be the position of the voxel to interact with.

		<member name="previous_position" type="Vector3i" setter="" getter="get_previous_position" default="Vector3i(0, 0, 0)">
			Integer position of the previous voxel along the ray before the final hit. In a blocky game, this would be the position of the voxel to place on top of the pointed one.
